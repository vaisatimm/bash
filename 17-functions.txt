--- Creating a function ---

function function-name () {
	# Code goes here.
}

function-name () {
	# Code goes here.
}

--- EXAMPLE ---

#!/usr/bin/env bash

function hello() {
    echo "Hello!"
}
hello

In this example we underline how to write and call a function by just writing the name
of the function without brackets.

--- EXAMPLE ---

Notice that you can call other functions in a function as you call a function after it is declared:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
function hello() {
    echo "Hello!"
    now 	#This is the invokation of the following declared function. We can call a function that will be declared later.
		#but you can't call hello till you don't declare now().
}


function now() {
    echo "It's $(date +%r)"
}

hello

---------------------

$0 = the script itself, not the fuction name. 


--- EXAMPLE OF POSITIONAL PARAMETERS PASSED TO A FUNCTION ---

#!/usr/bin/env bash

function hello() {
    echo "Hello $1"
}

hello Jason #Here we are calling the function hello and then passing Jason as a parameter for $1

# Output is: Hello Jason
