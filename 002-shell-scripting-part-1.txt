--- Tests ---

You can use tests to prove certain conditions.

Syntax:
	[ condition-to-test-for ]

Example: 
	[ -e /etc/passwd ]

In this example we are testing if the file passwd exists.

If the file exists then the status code is 0, if not it's 1.

You can see all the file operators for tests writing "man test".

-d FILE			True, if file is a directory;
-e FILE 		True, if file exists;
-f FILE			True, if file exists and is a regular file;
-r FILE 		True, if who launch the scripts has the permission to read the file;
-s FILE			True, if file exists and is not empty;
-w FILE			True, if file is writable by the user who launches the script;
-x FILE			True, if file is executable by the user who launches the script;
-z FILE 		True, if string is empty;
-n FILE			True, if string is not empty;
STRING1=STRING2 	True, if strings are equal;
