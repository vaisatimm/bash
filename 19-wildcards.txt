If you want to find a one carachter file that has a vowel than use this expression: 

[aeiou]

If you want to match words that begins with "ca" and end with a second part of the name that
contains "n", "t" and/or with a following part than you can write:

ca[nt]*

This will match:

- can;
- cat;
- candy;
- catch.

If you want to match all the files that do not begins with a vowel than:

[!aeiou]*

Some nice examples:


root@vaisatimm:~/desk/Bash# ls -1 [!01]*
file1.yaml
file2.yml

test:
root@vaisatimm:~/desk/Bash# mv *.y{a,}ml test/
root@vaisatimm:~/desk/Bash# ls -1 test/
file1.yaml
file2.yml
root@vaisatimm:~/desk/Bash#


This syntax "*.y{a,}ml" says: take all the elements ending in yaml or yml, which is the secondo element
after the "," that is next to "a".

ls *.txt        # tutti i file che finiscono con .txt

ls [0-9]*       # file che iniziano con una cifra
ls [!0-9]*      # file che NON iniziano con una cifra
ls **/*.log     # tutti i .log in qualsiasi sottodirectory (se globstar attivo)
