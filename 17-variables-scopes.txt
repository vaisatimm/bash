If a variable is defined at the very top of your script than it is available at any level in the script.

If it is define just before the call of a function it is available from that point on, inside the following functions.

If a variable is define just inside a function, then it is available just inside the function. 

If a variable is defined inside a function, until that function is not called and executed, that variable is not available outside the function itself.

#!/bin/basH
my_function() {
    GLOBAL_VAR=1
}

# GLOBAL_BAR not available yet.
echo $GLOBAL_VAR
my_function
# GLOBAL_VAR is NOW available.

echo $GLOBAL_VAR

You can create a local variable inside a function using the word "local" before the name of the variable:

local LOCAL_VAR=1

Only functions can have local variables.
